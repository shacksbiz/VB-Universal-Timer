Visual Basic running on Visual Stuido Community 2017

This may or may not drop right down in your Visual Studio Community.  Regardless, the code for the XAML and for the code the .vb code will be useful to understaing this project.

It is from my book Raspberry Pi and Visual Basic - Programming Windows 10 IoT
